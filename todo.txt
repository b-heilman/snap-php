The project is currently the combination of 6 years of development.  Some parts are very old, others are a newer.

Old sections needing updated :
DB Adapter - Currently only mysqli, PDO would be nice adding
\Snap\Lib\DB - And old attempt at creating a generic SQL model that could the be decoded by adapters

Future updates
The JS system isn't yet included, I am rewriting how it works.  Will be added shortly.
